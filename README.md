# bjText: Text Editor

## Your Task


Your task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

This application employs indexDB as a storage solution for saving notes, code snippets, and other user-selected data. It can be installed and run offline, thanks to a service worker that caches data in the background. The project was built, bundled, and optimized using Webpack and Workbox for efficient performance.

## User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
